# Color_Palette_Selector
Picking colors is hard. This program facilitates the process. 

It can show all possible harmonious color combinations according to three possible color schemes. 

User selects from a dropdown of possible color schemes including triad, analagous, or split-complementary. Three blocks display each color, along with their hue value (according to HSL input). A randomize button gives users the option to randomly generate three colors according to the selected scheme. A 'start sequence' button  continuously runs through all possible color combinations over a 20 second period. The user can use the 'stop button' to stop the sequence at any time.
